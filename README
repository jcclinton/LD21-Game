Ludum Dare 48 hour project.

This is my game for Ludum Dare 21

The game uses the open-source Cake library: https://github.com/MichaelCereda/CakeJs

It uses an open-source A* library: https://github.com/bgrins/javascript-astar

Instructions:You are the legendary hero Spartacus and your soldiers have been captured by the evil roman legions!

You must help them escape the jail and get them to exit

But the Roman Guards are going to try stop you. They’ll kill your soldiers if you don’t get them first!

To win the game you must move 10 soldiers to the exit.

To move Spartacus, you can drag to a spot with the mouse. You can also use the arrow keys to move him (but you must click him first)

To help your soldiers, you must set waypoints from the jail. To set a waypoint, drag the jail to where you want your soldiers to go. You may place 3 waypoints.

notes:
-guards will never spawn to the left of the first safety zone (ie the brown line)
-there can only be so many guards that are active at once, once their ranks are full, they stop spawning
-guards are inherently lazy, and they will lose interest after a while. Once this happens they will leave and new guards will come in to take their place.
