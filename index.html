But the Roman Guards are going to try stop you. They will kill your soldiers if you don't get them first!

<p>
<h3 style="color: #cca">The goal of the game is to move as many soldiers to the exit before time runs out.</h3>
</p>
<br/>
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<p>
Drag Spartacus with the mouse to move him. You can also use the arrow keys to move him (but you must click him first).
</p>
<p>
To help your soldiers, you must set waypoints from the jail. To set a waypoint, drag the jail to where you want your soldiers to go. You may place 3 waypoints. Once you add your first waypoint, drag the green box to add another.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
If Spartacus comes near a Roman guard, he will kill him
</li>
<li>
If a Roman guard comes near one of your soldiers, he will kill the soldier
</li>
<li>
If a soldier reaches the exit, he escapes and you get a point
</li>
</ul>

	<div style="clear:both"></div>
</div>
<p style="margin-top:40px;">
<strong>Tips:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Spartacus can't move as fast as the guards, use your waypoints to get around them when Spartacus is not around!
</li>
<li>
Spartacus has a bigger kill range than the guards, use this to block guards from your escaping inmates.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
<strong>Notes:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Helping soldiers escape will infuriate the guards! The more that have escaped, the more guards will be sent.
</li>
<li>
On the other hand, helping soldiers escape will give your soldiers a morale boost and will extend your time.
</li>
<li>
The outline of the game is a brown line, and it also bisects the gameboard in two places.
</li>
<li>
Units cannot move outside the brown outline, that is out-of-bounds.
</li>
<li>
guards will never spawn to the left of the first safety zone (ie the left brown line)
</li>
<li>
there can only be so many guards that are active at once, once their ranks are full, they stop spawning
</li>
<li>
guards are inherently lazy, and they will lose interest after a while. Once this happens they will leave and new guards will come to take their place.
</li>
</ul>
